# explore-angular
This repository will contain a working application to demonstrate the posts I will be making here: [wordsofcode.com](http://www.wordsofcode.com)

The application will use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to resolve dependencies. The application will be bundled with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

Feel free to post questions and issues to the [issues page](https://github.com/SonofNun15/explore-angular/issues)
